# Mister :: Clausulazos
**Why this project?**
We are users of football game called Comunio but for the season 2019/2020 we moved to Mister, a similar game but with more powerful tools to configure the game as we want. 
Because of this, one of this extra feauture is buy player from other user paying their clause, but we do it with this condition: each first tursday of month, each user announces the player who wnats buy and next day, the purchase is completed 

**Main goal**
Help you to buy players paying their clauses. With this tool you can check your players, see player of other users by position/points and their values and clauses also.

You can find a section with a basic AI to advice which players buy for each position.

**Development**
To do this project, the development has been the most simple possible.
- No databases and frameworks has been used
- Data has been managed with CSV files
- The style with Bootstrap
